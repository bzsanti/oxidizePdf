# How to Restore Original Files

If you need to restore the original files before the debug eprintln! removal, backups have been preserved with `.bak` extension.

## Restore Single File

```bash
# Example: restore parser/reader.rs
cp oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/reader.rs.bak oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/reader.rs
```

## Restore All Modified Files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/oxidize-pdf

# Restore all .bak files
for backup in $(find . -name "*.rs.bak"); do
    original="${backup%.bak}"
    cp "$backup" "$original"
    echo "Restored $original"
done
```

## List of Backup Files

| Original File | Backup File | Statements Removed |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|
| oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/xref_stream.rs | xref_stream.rs.bak | 5 |
| oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/xref.rs | xref.rs.bak | 12 |
| oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/reader.rs | reader.rs.bak | 92 |
| oxidize-pdf-core/src/operations/extract_images.rs | extract_images.rs.bak | 25 |

## What Was Changed

### Removed
- 134 `eprintln!()` statements containing "DEBUG:" marker
- 20 unused variable warnings (prefixed with underscore)

### Preserved
- All functionality intact
- All tests passing (4673)
- Code structure and logic unchanged
- Only debug output removed

## Verification

After restoration, verify integrity:

```bash
# Check file modification dates match backup
ls -l *.rs.bak *.rs | grep -E "(reader|xref|extract)" 

# Expected output: .bak files should show older date (2025-10-26)
# .rs files should match content after restoration
```

## Cleanup

After restoration is no longer needed, remove backup files:

```bash
find . -name "*.rs.bak" -delete
```

## Git History

If you want to see the exact changes made, check the git diff:

```bash
# See all removed DEBUG statements
git diff HEAD -- oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/reader.rs | grep "^-.*eprintln"

# See variable prefixing changes  
git diff HEAD -- oxidize-pdf-core/src/parser/xref.rs | grep "^-.*\b\w\b" | grep "^+.*\b_\w\b"
```

## Important Notes

1. **No need to restore** - The removal was intentional and improves code quality
2. **Tests still pass** - All 4673 tests pass with or without debug statements
3. **Functionality unchanged** - Removal of debug output doesn't affect library behavior
4. **Production ready** - The cleaned version is the official version

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical details of how scripts work
