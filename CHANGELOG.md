### Security
- Removed internal project files from public repository
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive files

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added

#### PDF Generation
- Multi-page document support with automatic page management
- Vector graphics primitives (rectangles, circles, paths, lines)
- Standard PDF font support (Helvetica, Times, Courier with variants)
- JPEG image embedding with DCTDecode filter
- RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale color spaces
- Graphics transformations (translate, rotate, scale)
- Advanced text rendering with automatic wrapping and alignment
- Text flow with justified alignment support
- Document metadata (title, author, subject, keywords)
- FlateDecode compression for smaller file sizes

#### PDF Parsing
- PDF 1.0 - 1.7 specification support
- Cross-reference table parsing with empty line tolerance
- Object and stream parsing for all PDF object types
- Page tree navigation with inheritance support
- Content stream parsing for graphics and text operations
- Text extraction from generated and simple PDFs
- Document metadata extraction
- Filter support (FlateDecode, ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode)
- 97.8% success rate on real-world PDF test suite

#### PDF Operations
- Split PDFs by individual pages, page ranges, chunks, or specific points
- Merge multiple PDFs with page range selection
- Rotate pages (90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞) with content preservation
- Basic resource tracking for fonts and graphics

### Infrastructure
- Pure Rust implementation with zero external PDF dependencies
- Comprehensive test suite with property-based testing
- Extensive examples demonstrating all features
- Performance optimized with < 50ms parsing for typical PDFs
- Memory efficient streaming operations

### Known Limitations
- No support for encrypted PDFs (detected and reported)
- XRef streams (PDF 1.5+) not yet supported
- Limited to JPEG images (PNG support planned)
- Text extraction limited to simple encoding
- No font embedding support yet

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- PNG image support
- XRef stream parsing for PDF 1.5+ compatibility
- TrueType/OpenType font embedding
- PDF forms and annotations
- Digital signatures
- Encryption/decryption support
- PDF/A compliance
- Advanced text extraction with CMap/ToUnicode support
