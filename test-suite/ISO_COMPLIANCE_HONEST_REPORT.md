## Conclusion

The oxidize-pdf library has a **real ISO 32000-1:2008 compliance of 17.8%**. While the library provides solid basic PDF generation capabilities, it lacks many features that would be expected from a library claiming 60%+ compliance.

The library is suitable for:
- Simple PDF document generation
- Basic graphics and text
- Standard fonts only

The library is NOT suitable for:
- Complex PDF manipulation
- Custom fonts or advanced typography
- Interactive PDFs
- Image-heavy documents
- Secure or encrypted PDFs
