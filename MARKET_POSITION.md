# Market Position: oxidize-pdf

## üéØ Our Positioning: "The Modern PDFSharp in Rust"

### Executive Summary
oxidize-pdf is positioned as a **modern, safe, and performant alternative to PDFSharp**, targeting developers who value:
- Zero dependencies
- Memory safety
- Superior performance
- Small binary size
- True cross-platform support

We are **NOT** trying to compete with iText or Aspose. We are the open-source choice for modern applications.

## üìä Honest Market Assessment (August 2025)

### Where We Win TODAY

| Use Case | Why We Win | Competitor Weakness |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Embedded Systems** | 5.2 MB binary, zero deps | PDFSharp needs .NET runtime |
| **High-Performance Batch** | 215 PDFs/second | PDFSharp: 100 PDFs/s |
| **Security-Critical Apps** | Memory safety guaranteed | C# has null pointer exceptions |
| **Rust Ecosystem** | Native Rust library | Others need FFI/bindings |
| **Microservices** | Tiny container images | IronPDF needs 200+ MB Chrome |
| **Cross-Platform CLI** | Single binary, any OS | PDFSharp tied to .NET |

### Where We DON'T Compete (Yet)

| Use Case | Why We Lose | Who Wins |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **PDF/A Archival** | Not implemented | PDFSharp 6.2, iText |
| **Accessibility (508)** | No PDF/UA support | PDFSharp 6.2, iText |
| **Digital Signatures** | No crypto implementation | All competitors |
| **Complex Forms** | No JavaScript | iText, Aspose |
| **Enterprise Support** | No SLA/phone support | Commercial vendors |
| **.NET Developers** | No native C# API | PDFSharp (obvious) |
