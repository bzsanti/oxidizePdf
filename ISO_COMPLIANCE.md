## Known Limitations

1. **PNG Support**: Native decoder has compression issues - 7 tests consistently failing. Advanced features like interlacing not supported
2. **Form Fields**: Appearance streams are generated but interactive editing is not fully implemented
3. **Annotations**: Basic types work but advanced features like reply threads are missing
4. **Transparency**: Basic soft masks work but complex transparency groups are incomplete
5. **Examples**: Missing examples for core features (merge, split, text extraction) - being added
6. **Documentation**: Some features marked as complete may have partial implementations - ongoing audit

## Conclusion

With the Quick Wins phase complete, oxidize-pdf has reached **~37% pragmatic ISO 32000-1:2008 compliance**. The focus on PNG support, image masks, form fields, and annotations has provided essential features for PDF generation while maintaining our zero-dependency philosophy for core functionality.

The next phases will focus on completing the graphics model, advancing interactive features, and improving font support to reach our 60% Community Edition target by Q4 2026.
