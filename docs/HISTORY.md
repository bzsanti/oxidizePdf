- Improved PNG chunk validation

### Issues Resolved
- Reduced PNG test failures from 10 to 8
- Fixed duplicate method definitions in forms
- Corrected TextContext API usage in examples

## 2025-07-28: ISO Compliance Documentation
### Key Finding
- PDF functionality: Basic features implemented
- Updated all documentation with accurate information
- Created roadmap for enhanced PDF features

### Documentation Updated
- README.md, ROADMAP.md, ISO_COMPLIANCE.md

## 2025-07-21: PDF Parsing Breakthrough
### Achievement
- **Success Rate**: 74.0% → 97.2% (+23.2% improvement)
- **Performance**: 215+ PDFs/second with parallel processing
- Resolved all 170 circular reference errors

### Statistics
- Total PDFs: 749
- Successful: 728 (97.2%)
- Expected failures: 21 (encrypted: 19, empty: 2)

### Custom Command
- Implemented `/analyze-pdfs` for automated analysis

---

## 2025-07-19: CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
### Completed
- Fixed all clippy warnings and format issues
- Resolved 387 tests + 67 doctests
- Achieved ~50% real test coverage

### Common Patterns Fixed
- `std::io::Error::other()` usage
- Unnecessary `.clone()` on Copy types
- `.values()` preference over `(_, value)` iteration

---

## 2025-07-17: Repository Architecture
### Dual Repository Strategy
- Public: oxidize-pdf (Community Edition)
- Private: oxidizePdf-pro (Pro features)
- License validation system
- Semantic features separated

### REST API
- Complete merge endpoint
- Multipart form data support
- Comprehensive error handling

---

## 2025-07-16: Major Milestones
### First Official Release
- v0.1.2 published to crates.io
- GitHub Actions pipeline fully automated
- Dual testing system (synthetic + real PDFs)

### Test Coverage Explosion
- CLI: 0% → 85% coverage
- Object streams: 0% → 100% coverage
- Arrays: 0% → 100% coverage
- Total: 1274+ tests

### New Systems
- Criterion.rs benchmarking suite
- OCR provider framework (Tesseract)
- Page extraction feature
- Page analysis (scanned vs vectorial)

## Historical Performance Metrics

| Date | Tests | Coverage | PDF Success | Compliance |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-07-16 | 175 | 43% | 74% | 25% |
| 2025-07-19 | 387 | 50% | 74% | 30% |
| 2025-07-21 | 1053 | 50% | 97.2% | 34% |

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- Workspace with multiple crates
- Trait-based extensibility (OCR, Export)
- Feature flags for optional dependencies
- Parallel processing by default

### Quality Standards
- Warnings as errors
- 80% minimum coverage (95% target)
- Property-based testing
- Automated benchmarking

### Release Strategy
- GitHub Actions only (no manual releases)
- Automatic crates.io publication
- Merge to main on release
- Independent version tracking

---

## Lessons Learned

### Testing
- Real PDFs reveal issues synthetic ones don't
- Property tests catch edge cases
- Coverage != quality (but helps)
- Benchmarks prevent performance regression

### PDF Complexity
- Circular references are common
- Encryption blocks ~2.5% of PDFs
- XRef recovery is critical
- Parser robustness > strict compliance

### Development Process
- Small, focused PRs work best
- Fix warnings immediately
- Document decisions in code
- Keep examples working always
