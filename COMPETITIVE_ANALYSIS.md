**Timeline**: Q1 2026
**Features**:
- Digital signatures
- Complete forms support
- Font subsetting
- Advanced tables

**Result**: Viable alternative to PDFSharp with better performance

#### Phase 2: Challenge QuestPDF (70% compliance)
**Timeline**: Q3 2026
**Features**:

**Result**: Open-source alternative to iText/Aspose

## .NET Wrapper Strategy

### Business Case for .NET Wrapper

**Pros**:
- Large .NET market (~6M developers)
- Limited open-source options (PDFSharp, QuestPDF)
- Performance advantage over managed code
- Memory safety as differentiator

**Cons**:
- Need 60%+ compliance first
- PDFSharp is "good enough" for many
- Interop complexity
- GPL license concerns

### Implementation Approach

```csharp
// Proposed .NET API
using OxidizePdf.NET;

var document = new PdfDocument();
document.AddPage(page => {
    page.Canvas.DrawText("Hello from Rust!", 100, 700);
    page.Canvas.DrawRectangle(50, 50, 200, 100);
});
document.Save("output.pdf");

// Performance: Rust backend, C# frontend
// Safety: Memory-safe operations
// Size: ~10MB NuGet package
```

### Market Entry Requirements

1. **Technical Requirements**:
   - 60% ISO compliance minimum
   - Stable C ABI
   - Comprehensive .NET wrapper
   - NuGet packaging

2. **Business Requirements**:
   - Dual licensing option
   - Professional documentation
   - Migration guides from PDFSharp
   - Performance benchmarks

## Pricing Strategy Recommendations

### Community Edition (GPL-3.0)
- **Price**: Free
- **Target**: Open source projects, individuals
- **Features**: 60% ISO compliance
- **Support**: Community only

### Professional Edition (Commercial)
